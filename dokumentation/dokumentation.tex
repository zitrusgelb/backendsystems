\section{Introduction of the Project Topic}
%Summarize the domain and describe a few (but not all) use cases of your software.

%Clear and concise summary of the domain. 
%Description of use cases is relevant and demonstrates an understanding of the problem domain.

\section{Description of the Software Architecture}
%Explain your interpretation of the hexagonal architecture. 
%What belongs to the domain? 
%What is the business logic? 
%What are the infrastructure components?
%How did you implement ports and adapters? 
%What was the most difficult aspect to learn when implementing this architecture?

%Correct and thorough explanation of the hexagonal architecture.
%Clear distinction between domain, business logic, and infrastructure components.
%Explanation of ports and adapters and how they were implemented.
%Reflection on challenges faced during implementation.

\section{Explanation of the API Technology}
%Why did you choose this technology? 
%Do you see any advantages of this technology for this project?

%Justification for choosing the specific API technology (gRPC, GraphQL, or REST).
%Identification of advantages relevant to the project.
%Consideration of any limitations or trade-oﬀs of the chosen technology.

\section{Implementation Details}
%For example, how did you implement authentication?
%How did you implement the mapping in the adapters? 
%Did you use any framework like REST Easy, Jersey, or Spring? 
%Why did you choose this framework?

%Explanation of implementation choices (e.g., authentication, adapter mapping).
%Justification of framework choice (e.g., REST Easy, Jersey, Spring).
%Level of detail in the technical description (must be clear and understandable).

\section{Testing Strategy}
%How did you implement unit and integration tests?

%Explanation of the testing strategy, including unit and integration tests.
%Description of how tests were implemented and what was tested.
%Reflection on the eﬀectiveness of the testing strategy.

\section{Learning Outcomes and Reflection}
%What did you learn from this project? 
%What worked well, and what would you do diﬀerently in the future?
%Reflect on team collaboration and the use of hexagonal architecture.

%Clear articulation of key learning outcomes from the project. (1 Point)
%Honest reflection on what worked well and what could be improved. (1 Point)
%Insightful discussion of team collaboration and the use of hexagonal architecture.
